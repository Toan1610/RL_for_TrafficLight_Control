GraphSAGE + Bi-GRU Layer for Network Embedding.

This module implements the GraphSAGE aggregation combined with 
Bidirectional GRU for capturing SPATIAL features from neighbors
in the MGMQ architecture.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
    BiGRU in this module is used for SPATIAL aggregation (over directions or neighbors),
    NOT for temporal sequence processing.
    
    - DirectionalGraphSAGE: BiGRU aggregates over 4 SPATIAL directions (N, E, S, W)
    - NeighborGraphSAGE_BiGRU: BiGRU aggregates over K neighbors in star-graph topology

    Directional GraphSAGE with Bi-GRU Aggregation.
    
    This module implements the "Directional/Topology-aware" GraphSAGE mechanism:
    1. Projects node inputs into 5 directional vectors (Self, N, E, S, W).
    2. Aggregates neighbor information such that:
       - Input at North port comes from South outputs of neighbors.
       - Input at East port comes from West outputs of neighbors.
       - etc.
    3. Uses a Bi-Directional GRU to aggregate these directional inputs into a single embedding.
    
    IMPORTANT: BiGRU here processes a sequence of 4 SPATIAL DIRECTIONS (N, E, S, W),
               NOT a temporal sequence.
